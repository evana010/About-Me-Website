        <div class=Special_text>Student Ambassador– 2018-2019 - University of Sheffield</div>
        Mentored students in years 9 through 11 helping them with their GCSEs, with a particular focus on teaching science and mathematics. As part of this role I worked with a group of mentees, I prepared my own lessons specifically for each student to make sure the learning was tailored to their needs.
        <ul>
           <li>
                This role therefore required a lot of organisation to plan these lessons in detail while also carrying out my university studies. I also had to acquire any materials I needed for each lesson like worksheets, stationery and laptops if needed. 
           </li>
           <li>
                A big part of being a mentor and ambassador is leadership. It is important to keep the lessons on track and divert from any distractions or misbehaviour. Being a good role model is also Important

        <div class=Special_text>Volunteer at the Children’s Project – 2018-2019 - University of Sheffield</div>
        This was a project run by the University of Sheffield, organising fun activities that help children build their self-esteem and open opportunities. It works with students from primary schools who need extra support to provide them with the help they need.
        <ul>
           <li>
                Working with younger children required both leadership and patience. Misbehaviour was common among the children; it was therefore important to remail calm and deal with the situation professionally. 
           </li>
           <li>
                I also further developed my teamwork as I worked with fellow volunteers to run the activities in a fun and engaging way while also making sure the children were safe at all times.
