            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <hr>
            I am a Biomedical Science student from the University of Sheffield. Throughout my course I have learnt about the complex structure and interactions of the human body, and how faults within this can lead to a range of conditions and diseases. The modules I have taken have focused on human anatomy, cell and molecular biology, neuroscience, physiology and pharmacology, stem cells and more. This has given me in-depth knowledge of the biology surrounding the human condition.<br>
            I have a growing interest in the field of research and development. It will allow me to use the skills I have gained throughout my university courses and work experience to facilitate the ever-growing advancements in medicine and health.<br>
            In addition to this I am also learning computer programming. I feel this is a useful skill to have as disciplines such as bioinformatics could be the future of biological research. I have take several online courses in my spare time such as a Python course from Udemy and a course in Web Development from Code First Girls.<br>
